6-8 Despite its flaws, <game> proves that there's still a lot of life left in this genre.
6-8 A charming little game, and one I'm sure fans will come back to for years to come.
5-7 <game> feels more constrained than it needs to be, and is in dire need of updates or DLC to keep it going long term.
6-8 I maintain that <game> is a good game. Great, even, if you're playing cooperatively.
9-10 Brilliant level design and a great aesthetic keep the game fresh from start to finish.
2-5 It's almost like developer <developer> had two really cool ideas and tried to integrate them both into <game>, with mixed results.
1-4 It feels like you're just aimlessly wandering another barren landscape, in search of a rush.
4-6 When I think about <game> as a whole, I'm reluctant to say it's good.
4-6 It's a silly idea and it seems like developer <developer> had a lot of fun building all of the different modes, but I wish I were having that much fun playing it.
9-10 <game> reminds me of why I love video games.
7-10 Probably the most original game I've played to completion in the past five years, and worth every penny of its asking price.
